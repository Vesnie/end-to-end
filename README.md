Loan Predictions
-----------------------

The purpose of this project is to predict whether or not loans acquired by Fannie Mae will go into foreclosure in the furture.

Fannie Mae acquires loans from other lenders as a way of inducing them to lend more, it also releases data on the loans it has aquired 
and their performance afterwards.

Data is located here: (http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/funding-the-market/data/loan-performance-data.html).
